# ESCAPE 3340

ESCAPE 3340 was a one-day, holiday-themed, student-designed escape room for the Yale community. Participants had to solve electronic puzzles to escape, including an RFID "present matching" puzzle, a digital "power generator" puzzle, a Hall Effect-sensing wooden sleigh, and an interactive "naughty/nice map." Escape Room Designers watched from the control room, and were able to send commands to help/hinder escape room participants through a fully-networked interface.

At the end of the escape room, the _social deduction_ element was revealed to participants. The day before, one participant from each group was notified that they are "The Grinch," and were instructed to sabotage their group's progress. At the end of the escape room, participants were to vote out who they thought was The Grinch.
